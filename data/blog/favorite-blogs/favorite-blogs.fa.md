summary: 'It is no coincidence that Père Lachaise Cemetery is a paradise for me, a paradise full of people who have played a significant role in my life. I will never forget the first time I came here, I was so excited to meet my favorite musician Frederic Chopin after all these years, but the doors were closed, I was late. But now I’m here to take you to the heaven, a different corner of this cold world.'
