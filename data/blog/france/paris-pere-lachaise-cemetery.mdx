## Marcel Proust

بعدی سنگ قبر “مارسل پروست” است، نویسنده و مقاله‌نویس فرانسوی. او به دلیل نگارش اثر عظیمش با عنوان “در جستجوی زمان ازدست‌رفته”، یکی از بزرگترین نویسندگان تاریخ ادبیات جهان قلمداد می‌شود. در واقع این یک سنگ قبر خانوادگی است، همچنین برادر او روبرت پروست، متخصص ارولوژیست و زنان و زایمان در همین جا خاک شده. چیز عجیب در اینجا این است که بلیط های متروی پاریس با سنگی کوچک را بر روی قبر آنها قرار میدادند، از چند فرانسوی پرسیدم، دلیلش را نمیدانستند، در اینترنت جستوجو کردم، دلیلش را یافت نکردم.
